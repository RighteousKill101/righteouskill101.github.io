                <h3>Leading Edge Website (IN PROGRESS)</h3>
                <p>I am currently building this website, from scratch, for my dad's business called "Leading Edge Construction
                    Services". This is currently how far I am into building that website, it will be updated in the future. Here
                    is a link to my github repository for my website: <a href="https://github.com/RighteousKill101/LeadingEdgeWebsite" target="_blank">Leading Edge Website</a>

                <h3>CIS-113 Final Project / Project 2</h3>
                <p>Me and another student from my CIS-113 class edited a pre-made website for our second CIS-113 Project,
                    and this is how it turned out. We edited the CSS and every page to look different. I do not have a before
                    and after, but I do have a list of changes made by me here: <a href="project2changes.html">Project 2 Changes</a>

                <h3>CIS-204 Project / Website</h3>
                <p>I made a mock Buffalo Bills website for my CIS-204 Project, the website includes an events calendar, a shop for
                    merchandise, a page for the current updated roster, and so much more. The project was made entirely with WordPress,
                    and some minor CSS changes, although there was so much CSS, I could barely find where to change stuff. The link for
                    the project is below, if it still works by the time you are reading this.
