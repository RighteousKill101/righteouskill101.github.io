This project is for my father's company called "Leading Edge Construction Services"

This will be his company's website for many years to come, and I chose GitHub as my repository for this website as I trust them and I have been using GitHub for the better part of 2 years. 
GitHub is extremely useful and very easy to use, and I have no issues using them.It allows me to upload my files, and it keeps history of any files I create. 
Best feature though is the fact that I can just use my repository link and continue to work on any device with Visual Studio Code.
