        <h2>Project 2 Parts 1 & 2</h2>
        <p>- I changed the general CSS that was used for every page I adapted in Part 1 & Part 2 of the project.</p>

        <h3>Project 2 Part 1</h3>
        <p>- I added images to the "About Us" page.</p>
        <p>- I embedded a video of USPS' instructions on how to mail a package on the refund page.</p>
        <p>- I embedded a Google Form into the "Checkout" page.</p>

        <h3>Project 2 Part 2</h3>
        <p>- I changed the layout of the "Main", "About", "Checkout", and "Refund" pages to use a grid-style layout and to look different between mobile and desktop versions of the website.</p>

        <h3><a href="index.html">Return to Index/Main Page</a></h3>
